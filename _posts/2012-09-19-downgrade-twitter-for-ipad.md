title: Downgrade twitter for iPad

Twitter for iPad V5.0 has just been released.
As usual I always have my App updated to the latest version.  
But this time I make a huge mistake is have my twitter App upgrade to version 5.0.
A huge step backward.
You know what I am taking about.  
Seriously, the useless top blue bar. You can do nothing but wait or close it while loading tweeted links .

So if you decide to downgrade you can do this by:
1. Delete the twitter App in your iPad.
2. Connect your iPad to iTunes.
3. Check the backup twitter and click Apply. This assume you have a backup. Lucky me. If you haven't backup you need to find an older one and install it.(ask your friends or google one)

Now you have your App downgrade Mission Accomplished.
